# LegacyLauncher / LaunchWrapper

Fork of <https://github.com/Mojang/LegacyLauncher/> with a patch to not crash under Java 9+. To use, you have to point your game launcher at it instead of the Mojang legacy launcher jar.

Used along with [HybridFix](https://github.com/HaHaWTH/HybridFix) for Forge to Bukkit access.
